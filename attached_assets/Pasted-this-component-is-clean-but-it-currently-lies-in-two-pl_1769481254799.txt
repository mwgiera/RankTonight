this component is clean, but it currently lies in two places (units + currency) and it misses the one metric that actually matters for your PERSONAL model (rev/hour). Fix those and the UI stops undermining credibility.

1) Your units are wrong
Your EarningsLog definition earlier: duration: number; // minutes

But you render:

{zone?.name || log.zone} - {log.duration}h
That’s incorrect. Convert minutes → hours (and show both if you want).

2) Your currency is wrong
You render $ and toFixed(2), but your model is PLN-oriented. Don’t hardcode $.

Use Intl.NumberFormat and label PLN (or make it a setting later).

3) Add rev/hour (the only number that matters)
This is the most important UX fix: show PLN/h right in the list item. It makes the “why” of ranking obvious and gives the user immediate feedback when logging.

Drop-in patch
Replace your formatting block + the two ThemedText lines with this.

  const zone = getZoneById(log.zone);
  const date = new Date(log.timestamp);

  // duration is minutes (per your model)
  const minutes = Math.max(0, log.duration ?? 0);
  const hours = minutes / 60;

  const revPerHour = minutes > 0 ? (log.amount / minutes) * 60 : null;

  const timeStr = date.toLocaleTimeString([], { hour: "2-digit", minute: "2-digit" });
  const dateStr = date.toLocaleDateString([], { month: "short", day: "numeric" });

  const money = new Intl.NumberFormat(undefined, {
    style: "currency",
    currency: "PLN",
    maximumFractionDigits: 0,
  }).format(log.amount);

  const perHour = revPerHour === null
    ? "— PLN/h"
    : `${new Intl.NumberFormat(undefined, { maximumFractionDigits: 0 }).format(revPerHour)} PLN/h`;

  const durationStr =
    minutes >= 60
      ? `${hours.toFixed(1)}h (${Math.round(minutes)}m)`
      : `${Math.round(minutes)}m`;
Then update the render:

<ThemedText type="small" style={{ color: theme.textSecondary }}>
  {zone?.name || log.zone} · {durationStr}
</ThemedText>
And update the amount display (remove $):

<ThemedText type="h3" style={{ color: theme.primary }}>
  {money}
</ThemedText>
<ThemedText type="caption" style={{ color: theme.textSecondary }}>
  {perHour} · {dateStr} {timeStr}
</ThemedText>
That’s it.

What this accomplishes
fixes the h vs minutes bug

fixes the $ vs PLN credibility leak

exposes rev/hour, which is what your PERSONAL scorer is actually using (or should be using)
