1. Primary issue (the real one)
The screen currently shows:

“Nightlife District”
Montag, 26. Jan., 23:19

But the system internally already knows:

it’s late-night

it’s weekend-like (Friday ≥ 20:00 logic now exists)

it’s a center / nightlife regime

Yet none of that is made explicit.

So the UI forces the user to infer context that the model already resolved.

That is backwards.

2. Mandatory adjustment: surface Context Mode
You need to expose one compact, authoritative context label.

Replace the single-line date header with:
Nightlife District · Weekend Mode
Mon 23:19
or even better (hierarchical clarity):

Nightlife District
Weekend Mode · Late Night (22–02)

This does three things:

Signals why recommendations differ from weekday behavior

Removes suspicion of randomness

Aligns user intuition with model regime

This is not UX sugar — it’s model explainability at the UI layer.

3. Zone list: add semantic reinforcement (small but important)
Right now all center zones look equal in the dropdown.

They are not equal at night.

Adjustment
Annotate center zones with behavioral tags, not categories.

Example:

Airport

Downtown (daytime bias)

Central Station (transit-heavy)

Nightlife District (late-night bias) ← highlighted

Business Park (weekday bias)

Do not add new logic.
This is just truthful labeling of what the model already assumes.

4. Selection state: strengthen visual authority
Currently the selected zone is just highlighted.

For “Nightlife District” at 23:19, it should own the screen.

Adjustments:
Slightly increase font weight for the selected zone

Add a subtle icon or marker (🌙 or similar, muted)

Keep it restrained — this is not gamification

You’re signaling: “You are in a different regime now.”

5. Confidence must be co-located with context
If the recommendation screen shows a platform ranking, the confidence badge must sit next to the context, not just near the result.

Why?
Because confidence is a property of context, not of the platform.

Example:

Context

Nightlife District

Weekend Mode

Late Night (22–02)

Confidence: Strong

This prevents a classic misinterpretation:

“The app is confident about Uber”
instead of the correct:
“The app is confident about this situation.”

That distinction matters at scale.

6. One critical micro-fix (precision)
Your header says “Montag” (German) while the rest of the UI is English.

That creates a subconscious “prototype” signal.

Decide:

full English, or

localized per language

But never mixed.

This is small, but for credibility it’s non‑negotiable.

7. What you should not do
Do not:

add explanations paragraphs

add onboarding text

add tooltips everywhere

Your user is operational, not exploratory.

Surface state, not commentary.

Executive summary (what to actually change)
If you do only three things, do these:

Expose “Weekend Mode / Late Night” explicitly in the header

Annotate zones with behavioral bias (nightlife, weekday, transit)

Tie confidence to context, not to the platform

That elevates this from “smart calculator” to situational decision system.
